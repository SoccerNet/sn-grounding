# SoccerNet-v2 - Replay Grounding

This repository contains the code to reproduce the replay grounding result of the paper: "SoccerNet-v2 : A Dataset and Benchmarks for Holistic Understanding of Broadcast Soccer Videos" with two three baslines:

 CALF method adapted to the 17 classes of SoccerNet-v2. The SoccerNet-v2 paper can be found here: [SoccerNet-v2 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.13367.pdf), and the CALF paper "A Context-Aware Loss Function for Action Spotting in Soccer Videos" here: [CALF paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPR_2020/papers/Cioppa_A_Context-Aware_Loss_Function_for_Action_Spotting_in_Soccer_Videos_CVPR_2020_paper.pdf).

The task consists in retrieving the timestamp of the action shown in a
given replay shot within the whole game.

## Getting Started

The following instructions will help you install the required libraries and the dataset to run the code. The code runs in <code>python 3</code> and was tested in a conda environment. Pytorch is used as deep learning library. 


### Create environment

To create and setup the conda environment, simply follow the following steps:

```bash
conda create -n CALF-pytorch python=3.8
conda activate CALF-pytorch
conda install pytorch=1.6 torchvision=0.7 cudatoolkit=10.1 -c pytorch
pip install SoccerNet
```


### Baselines

- SoccerNetv2-ReplayGrounding-CALF_more_negative [[Link]](SoccerNetv2-ReplayGrounding-CALF_more_negative)
- SoccerNetv2-ReplayGrounding-NetVLAD-More-Negative [[Link]](SoccerNetv2-ReplayGrounding-NetVLAD-More-Negative)

### Evluation on challenge set
Since Replay grounding task is retrieving the timestamp of the action shown in a given replay shot within the whole game, we need to know the start and end points of each replay. Hence, we provided auxiliary annotations for challenge set to address this issue. You can download it using this [[Link]](replay_labels_challenge.zip)  and unzip the file in the same directory that you have other labels and features
