SoccerNet-v2 is a large-scale dataset build upon SoccerNet that benchmarks the tasks of action spotting, camera shot segmentation / boundary detection and replay grounding. 
SoccerNet-v2 is composed of 300k manual annotations, span 500 complete soccer games from six main European leagues, covering three seasons from 2014 to 2017 and a total duration of 764 hours.

We propose the SoccerNet-v2 challenge to encourage the development of state-of-the-art algorithm for Generic Soccer Video Understanding. 
It is composed of 2 tasks:
 - **Action Spotting**: Spot the actions on a complete video of soccer game.
 - **Replay Grounding**: Ground the timestamp of the actions represented in a specific replay.

We provide an [evaluation server]() for anyone competing in the SoccerNet-v2 challenge. 
This evaluation server handles predictions for the open **test** set and the segregated **challenge** set.

Winners will be announced at ActivityNet Workshop at CVPR 2022. 
Prizes ðŸ’²ðŸ’²ðŸ’² include $1000 cash award ($500 for Action Spotting and $500 for Replay Grounding), sponsored by [SportRadar](https://www.sportradar.com/).


## Who can participate / How to participate?

 - Any individual can participate to the challenge, except the organizers.
 - The participants are recommended to form a team to participate.
 - Each team can have one or more members. 
 - An individual/team can compete on both task.
 - An individual associated with multiple teams (for a given task) or a team with multiple accounts will be disqualified.
 - On both task, a particpant can only use the video stream as input (visual and/or audio).
 - To help the participants, we provide pre-extracted ResNet-152 visual features at 2fps.
 - A particpant is allowed to extract its own visual/audio features with any pre-trained model.

## How to win / What is the prize?

 - For each task, the winner is the individual/team who reach the highest performance on the **challenge** set.
 - The metrics taken into consideration are the **tight Average-mAP for Action Spotting** and the **tight Average-AP for Replay Grounding**.
 - The deadline to submit your results is May 30th at 11.59 pm Pacific Time.
 - The teams that perform best in each task will be granted $500 from our sponsor [SportRadar](https://www.sportradar.com/).
 - In order to be eligible for the prize, we require the individual/team to provide a short report describing the details of the methodology (CVPR format, max 2 pages)
